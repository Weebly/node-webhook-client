# node-webhook-client

This is a simple webhook listener client written in Node.js as example server-side code for the Weebly Developer Platform. More information about the platform can be found at https://dev.weebly.com.

The server does two main things:

1. Acts as a server to facilitate an OAuth handshake between Weebly and your app
2. Provides an endpoint for webhook-enabled apps

### Usage

The server is intended to be deployed via Heroku, and will look to Heroku-flavored environment variables for specific keys.

For Heroku usage, after cloning this repository (and assuming you have the Heroku CLI installed):

```
heroku create
heroku config:set WEEBLY_CLIENT_ID=[your_apps_client_id]
heroku config:set WEEBLY_SECRET_KEY=[your_apps_secret_key]
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

For non-heroku usage, you can define your keys either within the code, or via other environment variables. 

### OAuth

This server has two main endpoints for OAuth; `/oauth/phase-one` and `/oauth/phase-two`. These correspond to the two endpoints as defined here: https://dev.weebly.com/configure-oauth.html. In order to enable OAuth on your app, you will need to define the following two lines in your `manifest.json`:

```json
{
	"callback_url": "[SERVER_INSTNACE]/oauth/phase-one",
	"oauth_final_destination": "editor"
}
```

After completing the OAuth flow, an access token will be dumped to the console. You can access the heroku logs via `heroku logs --tail`.

### Webhooks

By default, this server sets the scope of the OAuth app to solely webhooks, and comes with a POST endpoint at `/webhooks/callback`. To properly set up webhook events, add the following to your `manifest.json`: 

```json
{
	"callback_url": "[SERVER_INSTANCE]/webhooks/callback",
	"events": [

	]
}
```

The `events` key is an array of events; you can pick and choose events from the documentation here: https://dev.weebly.com/use-webhooks.html. 

On receiving a webhook, the server will write to the `messages/messages.txt` file; this file is accessible by navigating to the default route on your heroku instance (`/`), and thus is accessible via `heroku open`.
